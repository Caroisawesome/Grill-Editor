### AgentScript

AgentScript is a minimalist Agent Based Modeling (ABM) framework based on [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) agent semantics.  Its goal is to promote the Agent Oriented Programming model in a highly deployable [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)/JavaScript (CS/JS) implementation.
